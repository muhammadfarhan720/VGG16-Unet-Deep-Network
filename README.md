# VGG16-Unet
This project deploys a special Unet architecture for image segmentation where backbone of the encoder branch of U-net was loaded with VGG16 pretrained model.


# Models

--> **UNET_Road_Network** : This is a UNET model that can perform road extraction from sattelite images using image segmentation from the resized images generated from "image preprocessor.py" with 99% pixel accuracy.
