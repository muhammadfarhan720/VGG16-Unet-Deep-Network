# VGG16-Unet
This project deploys a special Unet architecture for image segmentation where backbone of the encoder branch of U-net was loaded with VGG16 pretrained model. It also compares the performance of pure UNET vs VGG-16 Encoder-UNET architecture for the case of road extraction from sattelite images.


# Models

--> **UNET_Road_Network.ipynb** : This is a demonstration of one of our UNET models that can perform road extraction from sattelite images using image segmentation with 99% pixel accuracy.
